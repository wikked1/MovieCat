# MovieCat

MovieCat wants to choose a movie for you and your Discord friends.  
Sometimes MovieCat gets confused. MovieCat is trying their best, though.

1. clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. create the file `src/auth.json` with contents like  
  `{ "token": "BotTokenHere", "channel": "ChannelIdHere" }`
4. `npm run start` to start the bot
5. program's main code is in `src/bot.ts`

In order to get a bot token, you'll need to create an app in the Discord Developer portal.  
See: https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html  
(and the rest of that guide for instructions on how to join the bot to a server, etc.)
